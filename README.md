## Python
*For SARSA implementation using Q table:*
```shell
$ cd python
$ python sarsa_Q_table.py
```

## Matlab

Each folder contains implementation of:
1. Q-table
2. Linear Neural Network 
3. Regular Back-propagation Neural Network
4. k-Winner-Take-All Back-propagation Neural Network

The results of the simulations are accessibale in the "papers" folder.
